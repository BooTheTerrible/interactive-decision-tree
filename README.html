<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Interactive Decision Tree is a web-based tool that will walk users through a decision process by asking questions to lead them down the appropriate decision path. Think of it as a user-friendly flow chart.</p>

<p>Decision tree data is stored as standard XML and the "viewer" is made up of HTML, CSS and Javascript. The fact that the viewer uses only client-side code allows a decision tree to be hosted on any flavor of web server or even from a local computer.</p>

<p>Also included is a PHP-driven decision tree editor. This allows users to create the underlying XML data for a decision tree more easily than manually editing XML files. The editor requires PHP version 5 or higher to be running on your web server. Since the editor far simplifies the process of creating decision trees, it is recommended that you use it as well. </p>

<p>A functional demo can be viewed at <a href="http://www.hungry-media.com/code/interactive-decision-tree/demo.html?0001">http://www.hungry-media.com/code/interactive-decision-tree/demo.html?0001</a></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>This section assumes you already have your web server up and running with PHP version 5 or greater.</p>
<code>
  # clone this repo
  # Modify the permissions of the xml/ directory such that it is writable by your web server.
  # Navigate to the editor page in your web browser: 
	e.g. http://your-web-server.org/decision-tree/editTree.php 
	(where _your-web-server_ is the domain name of your web server and _decision-tree_ is the directory created in step 2, above)
</code>

That's it. You should see a couple of example decision trees in the editor to experiment with.
