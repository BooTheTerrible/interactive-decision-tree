## Introduction

This is a fork of [HungryMedia's Interactive-Decision-Tree](https://github.com/hungrymedia/interactive-decision-tree)
which is a great tool for quickly implimenting web-based decision trees.  Decision trees are  great for law-related sites to
help users evaluate potential claims.

This project will make the following additions (in progress):

* Secure data
* User authorization
* User data tracking
* Bootstrap support
